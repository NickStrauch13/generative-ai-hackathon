Start with the mid setting: The mid setting is generally suitable for normal usage. It is the default setting that should maintain a proper freezing temperature.\n\n2. Adjusting the temperature: If you find the need to adjust the temperature, wait at least 24 hours between adjustments. This allows the freezer enough time to stabilize at the new setting. \n\n3. Making the freezer colder: To make the freezer colder, adjust the control to the next higher setting. This will increase the cooling power and lower the temperature inside the freezer.\n\n4. Making the freezer less cold: If you want to make the freezer less cold, back down the control to a lower setting. This will reduce the cooling power and raise the temperature inside the freezer.\n\n5. Allowing for cooling time: Whenever you make adjustments or before filling the freezer with food, allow the freezer to cool for six to eight hours. This ensures that the temperature stabilizes and reaches the desired level.\n\n6. Loading unfrozen food: If you have large amounts of unfrozen food to add, it is recommended to let the freezer cool overnight. This allows the freezer to reach its optimal freezing temperature before loading the food.\n\n7. Limiting unfrozen food: Never add more than two to three pounds of unfrozen food per cubic foot of freezer space. Overloading the freezer with unfrozen food can affect its ability to maintain proper freezing temperatures.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use the control on your standalone chest freezer and ensure that your food remains properly frozen.", "og_query": "freezer"}
