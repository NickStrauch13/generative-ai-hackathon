{"transcript": "In this video We can see the basic working function of the water cooled chiller plant Water cooled chiller plant has 5 equipments Water cooled chiller Condenser water pump Chilled water pump Cooling tower and AHU There are two important parts in chiller Evaporator and Condenser AHU and Chilled water pump are connected to the evaporator Cooling tower and Condenser water pump are connected to the condenser Next Chilled water pump and Condenser water pump These two pumps are supplying water to the AHU and Cooling tower Next, AHU It's job is to provide well cooled air to the room using the water that come from evaporator of the chiller Cooling Tower It reduces the temperature of the water coming from the condenser and sends it back to the condenser Now, let's see it's basic work the cooling tower and condenser water pump are connected to the condenser of the chiller The AHU and Chilled water pump are connected to the evaporator of the chiller the temperature of the water entering the cooling tower is 35 \u00b0C the cooling tower lowest the temperature of the water leaving the cooling tower at the temperature of 30\u00b0C this cycle continous Chilled water pump sends the water from Evaporator to the AHU the temperature of the water entering the AHU is 6 \u00b0C The AHU takes the cooling in that water  and sends the water out at temperature of 12 \u00b0C then the water goes to the evaporator and gets cooled and then again goes back into the AHU this is the basic working principle of  water cooled chiller plant We will see the details about each of these equipments in subsequent videos.", "response": "To clean a bowl and freezer, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Empty the bowl: Remove any food or items from the bowl and place them in a separate container or discard them if necessary.\n\n2. Rinse the bowl: Rinse the bowl with warm water to remove any loose debris or residue.\n\n3. Prepare a cleaning solution: Mix a solution of warm water and dish soap in a separate container. Use a mild dish soap that is safe for food contact surfaces.\n\n4. Clean the bowl: Dip a sponge or cloth into the cleaning solution and scrub the inside of the bowl, paying attention to any stubborn stains or residue. Rinse the bowl thoroughly with warm water to remove any soap residue.\n\n5. Dry the bowl: Use a clean towel or allow the bowl to air dry completely before using or storing it.\n\nFor cleaning the freezer, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Empty the freezer: Remove all food items from the freezer and transfer them to a cooler or another freezer if available. If necessary, discard any expired or freezer-burned items.\n\n2. Defrost the freezer: If your freezer has built-up ice or frost, turn it off and allow it to defrost naturally. Place towels or absorbent mats around the freezer to catch any water that may melt during the defrosting process.\n\n3. Clean the interior: Once the freezer is defrosted, remove any shelves, drawers, or removable parts. Wash them separately with warm water and mild dish soap. Wipe down the interior of the freezer with a sponge or cloth soaked in a solution of warm water and mild dish soap. Pay special attention to any spills or stains.\n\n4. Clean the exterior: Wipe down the exterior of the freezer with a damp cloth or sponge. Use a mild cleaning solution if necessary, but avoid using abrasive cleaners that may damage the surface.\n\n5. Dry and reassemble: Thoroughly dry all the parts and the interior of the freezer before reassembling it", "og_query": "clean bowl and freezer"}
