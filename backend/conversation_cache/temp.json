Ensure that the power to the camper is turned off and disconnect it from any power source.\n\n2. Locate the fuse box inside the camper. Check the fuses and breakers to ensure none are blown or tripped. Replace any blown fuses or reset any tripped breakers.\n\n3. Go outside to the back of the refrigerator. Remove the cover located behind the refrigerator.\n\n4. Look for a 110 plug where the refrigerator is connected. Remove the fuse box cover and check the fuse inside. Make sure the fuse is not blown. If it is, replace it with a new one.\n\n5. Look for a small reset switch located behind the schematic diagram inside the compartment. Press the reset button. You may hear a click, indicating that the reset was successful.\n\n6. Return inside the camper and check the status of the refrigerator. The amber light should now be on, indicating that the refrigerator is functioning properly.\n\n7. Give the refrigerator and freezer time to cool down. It may take 24 to 48 hours for them to reach the desired temperature. The freezer will typically cool down first, followed by the refrigerator section.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and fix any issues with your camper's refrigerator and freezer.", "og_query": "clean bowl and freezer"}
