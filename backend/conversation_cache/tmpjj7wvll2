{"transcript": "If your dryer is not drying like it\nused to, or maybe not drying at all, I'm gonna walk you through a few simple\nthings that you can check to make sure that it's working again. And if necessary show you how to replace\nsome parts to get it up and running, just like it should. The first\ntwo things we're gonna check, have to do with ventilation. Dryers need proper airflow in\norder to function properly. So first we'll check the dryer vent in\nthe back and make sure the air is getting out of the dryer and\nout of the house. Now, assuming that's all good. The next\nthing to check is your lint trap. And so the lint traps vary on\nhow they're actually set up here. I've got this one and there's\nvery little lint on here. I've got a little bit but this one\ngets cleaned out pretty regularly. So not an issue, got just about this much, but sometimes if this hasn't\nbeen cleaned in a while, you might have a huge amount of lint in\nthere that will block any airflow from going through the system properly. Now, assuming none of those are actually\nthe main issue that we're dealing with, we're gonna have to get into the\nmachine itself. And in order to do that, we want to know what types of\nparts we might need to deal with. There's a really simple way to find out\nwhat the model and make of your dryer is. And that's actually right here in the\ndoor. So on this label, right in here, we can easily see that this is a\nWhirlpool. We can see the model number. We can see type, we can see voltages\nand all kinds of other things. Our washer dryer set is pretty\nbasic. It's about 15 years old, but by doing some simple\nrepairs like this, we've been able to keep\nit going for many years. What's most likely the\nissue is this right here. This is called the heating element. I've ordered a new one based on the\nmodel number that we looked at earlier, and I'm ready to replace this. I have\nhad to do this before on this dryer, but guess how much this thing\ncosts? If you buy it on Amazon, and I'll put links in the description\nbelow, this was about $20. And then just to make sure there's also\na thing called a thermal fuse and these run about five to $6. So 26 bucks to be able to get this\nthing up and running and give it another several years is a lot cheaper\nthan buying a new dryer. So let's walk you through how to replace\nthese in case that's the issue with your dryer. Anytime you're looking at\nworking on the inside of the dryer, make sure to unplug it from the wall, whether that's the two 20\npower cord or the gas line, if you are using a gas line, make sure\nto shut off the supply valve first, before disconnecting, We got a lot of dust in here. So the two pieces we're going to\nbe replacing are the thermal fuse, this little $5 part right here. The\nother piece is the heating element. So it's this one right here and you'll\nsee, it looks just like this here. It's the same piece. One little caveat on this one is we do\nhave to take out the thermostat here from the existing one and put it on\nthe new one on the thermal fuse. I suspect that mine's actually just fine, but because it was only $5 and I don't\nwanna open everything back up in case something goes wrong down the\nline, I'm just gonna replace that. You can actually check for continuity\nto see if there's any issues there, but once we've got everything opened\nup back here, we can just take out, pull it out first. Again, which wire you put on\nhere doesn't really matter. Just make sure they're\non there snug. Next, we're gonna move over here to the heating\nelement as well as the thermostat. And just like before we want\nto remove all of these plugs, but one big difference is these plugs\nhere. The order definitely matters. So you might wanna take a photo of this\njust to remember exactly what this looks like and the order that these go on. And then I'm gonna just\ngo ahead and unattach, otherwise in the English language\nknown as detach. Okay. There's one, two and three. We're gonna go ahead and replace that one. We will first start by taking\nout the thermostat here. So our thermostat here is really just\nheld in place by mounting onto this little stub right here. And we can just\npull this whole thing off. And again, a screwdriver will make life\neasier until it comes loose. And then it's just being held in place\nby this little finger right here. And so that just slides through the hole\nso we can take that whole thing off, transfer it to our new heating element, slide on the new thermostat. And then, and once that's slid in place, we can slide the little\nsleeve over the stub here, and I'm just gonna push\nthis down now. So with that, we have the thermostat replaced\ninto the new heating element. One, two, and three on\nthis little one here With everything, put back\ntogether, the power plug back in. We're ready to try it out.\nSo let's put our timer on and off we go. Everything should\nbe working so much better now. And hopefully we get another\n15 years out of this machine.", "response": "If your dryer isn't drying your clothes, here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. Check the ventilation: Ensure that the dryer vent at the back of the machine is clear and not blocked. Make sure the air is properly venting out of the dryer and out of the house.\n\n2. Clean the lint trap: Remove the lint trap and clean it thoroughly. If it hasn't been cleaned in a while, there might be a buildup of lint that is blocking proper airflow.\n\n3. Check the model and make: Look for the label inside the dryer door to identify the model and make of your dryer. This information will be helpful if you need to replace any parts.\n\n4. Inspect the heating element: The heating element is a common culprit for drying issues. If you suspect it's the problem, you can order a new one based on the model number and replace it. Make sure to unplug the dryer before working on the inside.\n\n5. Replace the thermal fuse: Another part to consider replacing is the thermal fuse, which is a small, inexpensive component that can affect the dryer's performance. It's a good idea to replace it along with the heating element to ensure long-term functionality.\n\n6. Detach and reattach wires: Carefully remove and reattach the wires connected to the heating element and thermostat. Take note of the order in which the plugs are attached, as it matters.\n\n7. Test the dryer: Once everything is put back together, plug the dryer back in and turn it on. Set the timer and see if it starts drying properly. If all goes well, your dryer should be functioning better.\n\nRemember to always prioritize safety by unplugging the dryer before working on it and following any specific instructions provided by the manufacturer.", "og_query": "My dryer isnt drying my clothes?"}
